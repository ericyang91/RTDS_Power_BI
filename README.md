# Road to Data Science: Power BI
## Data Preparation

**To make Excel or CSV data Power BI compatible, your goal is to structure it in a clean, tabular, and relational-friendly format that Power BI can easily interpret and transform into visuals.**

---

**1. Structure your data in a tabular format**
- Each sheet (in Excel) or file (CSV) should resemble a table in a database.
- Each row should represent a single record or transaction.
- Each column should represent one variable or attribute.
- Power BI will easily recognize the "Good" table. It will struggle to understand the "Bad" one — especially if headers are spread across multiple rows/columns.

| Good Format               | Bad Format                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Column headers in row 1   | Column headers in row 3         |
| No merged cells           | Merged cells across months      |
| Each row = 1 data entry   | Headers split across rows/cols  |

---

✅ Example (Good Format)

| Date       | Product | Quantity | Price |
|------------|---------|----------|-------|
| 2025-06-01 | Apples  | 10       | 0.50  |

---

❌ Example (Bad Format – Merged header or missing labels)

|          | Apples | Oranges |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Quantity | 10     | 12      |
| Price    | 0.50   | 0.80    |

---

**2. Use proper headers**
- Headers = Column names, and they must:
  - Be in row 1 (no intro rows like “Sales Report Q2” above it).
  - Have no duplicates.
  - Use simple, descriptive names like ProductName, not Column1.
  - Power BI reads the first row as headers. If the first row contains actual data, you’ll have to fix it manually during import (Power Query → “Use First Row as Headers”).

---

**3. Avoid pivoted/crosstab layouts**
- Power BI prefers long format, not wide format.
- Why?
  - Visuals like bar charts and filters work better with vertical data.
  - You can use ```UNPIVOT``` in Power Query if needed.

---

❌ Pivoted Format (Not Ideal for Power BI)

| Region | Jan | Feb | Mar |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| West   | 100 | 200 | 150 |

---

✅ Unpivoted Format (Tidy / Power BI Friendly)

| Region | Month | Sales |
|--------|--------|-------|
| West   | Jan    | 100   |
| West   | Feb    | 200   |
| West   | Mar    | 150   |

- Power BI can now group by Region, filter by Month, and aggregate Sales.

---

**4. Use separate tables for each entity**
- Example setup for a sales dashboard:
  - ```Sales:``` Transactional table
  - ```Customers:``` Info on customers
  - ```Products:``` Product info (name, category, etc.)
  - ```Calendar:``` All dates
 - Each table should have:
  - A **primary key** (like ProductID).
  - Clean, distinct columns (no overlapping names unless it’s a key for a relationship).
  - Use **Model View in Power BI** to connect them (one-to-many relationships).

---

**5. Ensure clean data**
- Why this matters: Power BI auto-detects data types. Mixed types can break visuals or calculations.
- Watch out for:
  - Columns with numbers and text (12, 15, --N/A--).
  - Dates in wrong format (e.g., text "01/2024" instead of date 2024-01-01).
  - Totals/subtotals (these should be calculated in Power BI, not stored).

---

**6. Avoid extra rows/columns**
- Many Excel sheets start with title rows like:
  
TD SALES REPORT - Q2
 
Generated by: Eric

Date | Product | Qty | Price

  - ❌ Problem: Power BI may read these as data.
  - ✅ Solution: Remove these extra rows, or place clean tables on a separate sheet just for import.

---

**7. Save in Compatible Formats**
- Best practice:
  - Excel: .xlsx or .xls (keep sheets tidy)
  - CSV: UTF-8 encoding, comma-separated (no semicolons or tabs unless needed)
    - Why CSVs are nice:
      - Lightweight and load fast
      - Easy to version-control (e.g., Git)
      - Compatible across platforms

**8. Use a calendar table**

### 📅 Calendar Table Example

- Time intelligence (e.g., YTD, MOM, YOY) requires a full calendar — not just the dates in your data.
- A calendar table should include columns like:

| Date       | Year | Month | Quarter | Week | DayName |
|------------|------|--------|---------|------|---------|
| 2025-01-01 | 2025 | Jan    | Q1      | 1    | Wed     |
| 2025-01-02 | 2025 | Jan    | Q1      | 1    | Thu     |
| 2025-01-03 | 2025 | Jan    | Q1      | 1    | Fri     |
| 2025-01-04 | 2025 | Jan    | Q1      | 1    | Sat     |
| 2025-01-05 | 2025 | Jan    | Q1      | 1    | Sun     |
| 2025-01-06 | 2025 | Jan    | Q1      | 2    | Mon     |

- You can:
  - Generate it in Excel
  - Use Power BI DAX:
    - ```Calendar = CALENDAR(DATE(2020,1,1), DATE(2030,12,31))```
    - Then relate ```Sales[Date]``` → ```Calendar[Date]```.
   
---



**9. Avoid Formulas in Excel**

- Avoid using formulas like `=SUM(...)`, `=VLOOKUP(...)`, or `=IF(...)` in Excel — they can be fragile or lost when importing.
- Power BI uses its own formula language called **DAX**, which is more robust and scalable.
- Example (DAX):
```DAX
TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price])
```
- Best practice: Export raw data only from Excel or CSV, and do your calculations inside Power BI using DAX.

---

**10. Name Your Excel Tables (Optional but Useful)**

- In Excel:
  - Select your data → press Ctrl + T
  - Check "My table has headers"
  - Go to the Table Design tab → Rename it (e.g., SalesTable)
- Why this helps:
  - Power BI will recognize and list tables by name instead of "Sheet1".
  - Makes your queries more readable and manageable.
  - Easier refresh when the source file updates.
 
## Time Intelligence

- Time Intelligence is **one of the most important concepts in Power BI** — it lets you **analyze data over time**, such as comparing sales this year to last year, calculating year-to-date totals, or creating running totals. Mastering this requires
- **a separate calendar table**, and here’s a full breakdown of what you need to know.

---

**1. 📅 What Is Time Intelligence in Power BI?**
- Time Intelligence refers to DAX functions that help you perform calculations across dates — like:
  - Year-to-Date (YTD), Quarter-to-Date (QTD), Month-to-Date (MTD)
  - Previous periods (e.g., previous month, previous year)
  - Rolling averages, running totals
  - Same period last year
  - Comparing growth vs. past periods

---

**2. ❓ Why You Need a Separate Calendar Table**
- Power BI requires a proper date table to use time intelligence functions like ```TOTALYTD```, ```SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR```, etc.
  - Here's why:
    - **Completeness**: Your fact table (like Sales) may not contain every single date, especially if there were no transactions.
    - **Relationships**: Time intelligence functions require a relationship between your fact table and a continuous date table.
    - **Filtering & Grouping**: You can group by year, month, week, quarter, etc., from one source.
    - **Consistent Logic**: You can create time-based columns like “Fiscal Year,” “IsWeekend,” etc., once — and use them across your report.

 ---

 **3. 🛠️ How to Create a Calendar Table**
 - You have two common ways:
   - **Option 1: Auto-generated in DAX**
   - ```DAX
     Calendar = CALENDAR(DATE(2024,11,1), DATE(2025,10,31))
     ```
     - This creates a new table that contains **one column only**, named ```Date``` that contains **every single day** from November 1, 2024 to October 31, 2025. It is **continous, sequential with no gaps**. The column's Data type is **Date**.
     - 2024-11-01, 2024-11-02, etc.
     - This table **does not** include:
       - **Year**, **Month**, **Quarter** columns
       - **Month Names**, **Weekdays**, or **Fiscal logic**
       - **Sorting logic** for month names (e.g., Jan, Feb... ordered alphabetically unless fixed manually). 
   - **Option 2: With additional columns**
   - ```DAX
     Calendar = 
      ADDCOLUMNS (
          CALENDAR(DATE(2020, 1, 1), DATE(2030, 12, 31)),
          "Year", YEAR([Date]),
          "Month Number", MONTH([Date]),
          "Month Name", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
          "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
          "Day", DAY([Date]),
          "Weekday", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
          "IsWeekend", IF(WEEKDAY([Date], 2) > 5, TRUE, FALSE)
      )
     ```
| Date       | Year | Month Number | Month Name | Quarter | Day | Weekday   | IsWeekend |
|------------|------|---------------|-------------|---------|-----|------------|------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 2024 | 11            | November    | Q1      | 1   | Friday     | FALSE      |
| 2024-11-02 | 2024 | 11            | November    | Q1      | 2   | Saturday   | TRUE       |
| 2024-11-03 | 2024 | 11            | November    | Q1      | 3   | Sunday     | TRUE       |
| ...        | ...  | ...           | ...         | ...     | ... | ...        | ...        |
| 2025-10-31 | 2025 | 10            | October     | Q4      | 31  | Friday     | FALSE      |
